## python-mini-projects
A collection of small, clean, production-style Python projects built as part of my Python learning journey.

## This repository focuses on:
- Writing readable & maintainable code
Using best practices
- Thinking like a software engineer, not just finishing tutorials
- Many projects are inspired by the 100 Days of Python concept, but structured as real-world mini projects.

| Day | Project              | Description                           |
| --- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

| 02  | Number Guessing Game | Loops, conditionals, input validation |
| 03  | Password Generator   | Randomization & security basics       |
| …   | More coming          | 🚀                                    |
