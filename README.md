## python-mini-projects
A collection of small, clean, production-style Python projects built as part of my Python learning journey.

## This repository focuses on:
- Writing readable & maintainable code
Using best practices
- Thinking like a software engineer, not just finishing tutorials
- Many projects are inspired by the 100 Days of Python concept, but structured as real-world mini projects.

| Day | Project              | Description                           |
| --- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 01  | Band Name Generator  | Simple CLI app with clean structure   |
| 02  | Tip Calculator       | try and exception, input validation   |
| 03  | Pizza Deliveries     | CLI app with clean input handling     |
| 04  | Book Expense Tracker | A simple CLI app using SQLite         |


## What I’m Practicing
