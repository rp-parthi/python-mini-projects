## 💰 Tip Calculator (Day 02)

A simple Python command-line application that calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including tip.

This project focuses on **clean code structure**, **input validation**, and **thinking in a production-ready way**, rather than just making the program work.

---

## 🛠 Concepts Used

- Functions and modular design
- Input validation loops
- Type conversion (`str` → `int` / `float`)
- Error handling using `try / except`
- `main()` entry point
- f-strings for formatted output

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python src/main.py
